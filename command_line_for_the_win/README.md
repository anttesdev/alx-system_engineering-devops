This is command line for the win project.


Inorder to transfer the images through SFTP
I moved in to the directory where the screen shots were stored in my local machine.
Then I connected in to the SFTP remote machine, worked my way in to the command_line_for the_win directory

After that I used the puts command folowed by the name of the file to copy the file in to the remote machine.
